# 🕵️‍♂️ Fake Reviews Detection

## 📝 Problem Statement

Detection of fake reviews out of a massive collection of reviews having various distinct categories like Home and Office, Sports, etc. with each review having a corresponding rating, label i.e. CG (Computer Generated Review) and OR (Original Review generated by humans) and the review text.

The main task is to detect whether a given review is fraudulent or not. If it is computer-generated, it is considered fake; otherwise, it's not.

## 📄 Description

The generated fake reviews dataset contains **20,000 fake reviews** and **20,000 real product reviews**.  
- `OR` = Original Reviews (presumably human-created and authentic)  
- `CG` = Computer-Generated fake reviews

## 📊 Performance Overview of ML Models

| Model                     | Accuracy |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Support Vector Classifier| **88%**  |
| Logistic Regression      | 86%      |
| Random Forest Classifier | 84%      |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes  | 84%      |
| Decision Tree Classifier | 73%      |
| K-Nearest Neighbors      | 58%      |

Support Vector Classifier performed the most accurate predictions regarding the fake nature of reviews with a predictive accuracy of just over **88%**, closely followed by Logistic Regression (**86%**).  
The worst-performing model was K-Nearest Neighbors with only **58%** accuracy.
